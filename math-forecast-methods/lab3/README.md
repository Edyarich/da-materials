### Lab 310. Double pendulum

There given a low-resolution video of a pendulum as the source. And two time series, angle and acceleration, of this pendulum as the target. Given a point of the phase trajectory in the source space (4-way matrix), we have to forecast the angle and acceleration of the pendulum.
