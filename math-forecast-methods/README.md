## Mathematical Forecasting Methods

[Course Page](http://bit.ly/3QAOYPd)

The course joins two parts of the problem statements in Machine Learning.  
The first part comes from the structure of the measured data. The data come from Physics, Chemistry and Biology and have intrinsic algebraic structure. This structure is part of the theory that stands behind the measurement.  
The second part comes from errors of the measurement. The stochastic nature errors request the statistical methods of analysis. So this course joins algebra and statistics. It is devoted to the problem of predictive model selection.
